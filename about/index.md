# Data Philosophy
Data can have a big impact on understanding the world, illuminating dark corners that were previously unknown.  It can also be used inappropriately -- *for support rather than illumination* -- especially unconsciously.  This is why **data discipline matters.**

* Seeking the answer you want will inject bias. Knowing the answer you want will inject bias.  **This is often worse than no answer.**
* If you look to data to confirm you're right, **you are wrong.**
