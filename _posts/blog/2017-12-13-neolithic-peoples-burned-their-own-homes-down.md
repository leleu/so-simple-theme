# [Burned House Horizon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burned_house_horizon)

Imagery:
* Image of a site
* Shiva, the great destroyer

Facts: 
* In Neolithic Europe sites (7000BCE to 1700BCE in Greece, Turkey, and eastward) there is a well documented phenomenom of entire settlements burned to the ground every 76-80 years.
* Conflicting evidence, archaelogists are unsure if it was intentional or accidental.  But there are a ton of these sites, so if accidental, then fire was a MAJOR problem back then, and consensus is the majority were burned on purpose.

Possible Reasons:
* Turned the mud thatches into cermaic to waterproof
* Enemy aggression
* Recycling old housing material as the wattle and daub gets dilapidated looking
* Fumigation of pests
* Demolition to create space
* Symbolic end of house

Interpretation: 
* death->life
* destruction is a force of randomness that forces the gamesplayer to start fresh
* from time to time, it's important to restart
