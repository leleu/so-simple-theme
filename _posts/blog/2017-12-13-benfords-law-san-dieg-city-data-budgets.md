[Benford's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benford%27s_law) is an observation that certain real-world datasets have unbalanced distribution of leading digits.  It is applied by [forensic](https://www.journalofaccountancy.com/issues/2017/apr/excel-and-benfords-law-to-detect-fraud.html) [accountants](http://www.acfe.com/Benfords/) and is [formally studied by accountants](https://www.isaca.org/Journal/archives/2011/Volume-3/Pages/Understanding-and-Applying-Benfords-Law.aspx); it has been used to [identify possibly forged data in science experiments](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28653153).
